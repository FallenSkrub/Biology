# Protein Story

## Slide 1

> Can be as simple as Name of your protein, your name. If you want to work the actual human interest story into the title that’s fine

* Just put your name and the name of your protein.

## Slide 2

> Start with the human / get in a hook / foreshadowing. Ex. “*this is Billy *one day, Billy suddenly got very sick *doctors couldn’t figure out what was happening - with a picture of Billy on the right. Real people preferred to made up ones, and if made up, should be more serious / factual than jokey.

* Introduce your person, real or fictional

## Slide 3

> 1. How is this gene inherited? (DNA to DNA) Can be as simple as a discussion of **DNA replication** (use of bead model as a visual highly encouraged) or you can add some discussion of what chromosome the gene is on, what sort of Mendelian inheritance pattern tends to go with disorders of the gene. If you don’t use the bead model, need evidence that your graphic is specific to your gene (e.g. has the right sequence of As,Ts,Gs and Cs) (may need more than one slide)

Here's what he actually meant:

* Talk about what DNA replication is [this is what he gave us in honors.](https://bit.ly/DNArepAdvanced)

**OR**

* Explain what chromosome your protein is on, see [the document here, and find your protein.](https://bit.ly/Proteins2019) On the sidebar, find the "Gene" page, to find out which chromosome your protein is on.
* Also, explain the Mendelian inheritance patterns that go with the disorders of your protein. 

***REMEMBER:*** To include a bead model "recreating" the Coding to Template Strand

(You can also use a graphic for your protein, as long as it is accurate.)

### Unsolved Questions for Slide 3:
* Ask Addicott ask about what he means by, "what sort of Mendelian inheritance pattern tends to go with disorders of the gene."
* [Maybe useful?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK115561/)

## Slide 4
2. How is the gene transcribed? (DNA to RNA) What type of cells in the body do you think do most of this transcribing and why? Need to make yours specific to your protein - photos of your mRNA as it was being made may work. (may need more than one slide) Can base roughly on the video of the process 

## Slide 5
3. How is the protein put together? (RNA to Protein) Specifics on ribosome location (on ER or free ribisome? why?) and transport (if any) after the protein is made. Can base roughly on the reference simulation (bit.ly/TranslSim), but the Amino Acid sequence should be based on your coding DNA / mRNA sequence using the universal genetic code found in the (amino acids / translation resources slide deck). You may want to use the clip art amino acids from slide 5&6 of that deck, or you can make your own graphics (different colored circles with the AA codes is a common choice). You will need to create your own representation of a ribosome and tRNA adapter molecules. (will need more than one slide unless you make an animation that can play on a single slide)

## Slide 8
4. What does the protein do? (even better - how does it do it?) - picture of the 3D structure of the protein (Protein of the Month page, can surf around from the source DNA for 3D viewers, or can load your protein into the Nanome VR application and take screenshots). Probably just one slide unless you really dig into this.

## Slide 9
Back to the human of your story, link the protein’s function (or under/over/mis function) to what that person was experiencing. More pictures of a real person would be nice.
