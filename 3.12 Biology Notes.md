# 3.12 **Biology** Notes

## Review Questions
1. What are the main differences between the types of proteins associated with the plasma membrane?
2. Name three membrane protein functions.

## Vocab
* **Membrane protein**: A protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with the membrane of a cell or an organelle
    * **Integral Membrane Proteins (Intrinsic Proteins)**: Are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane. 
        * These proteins contain residues with hydrophobic side chains that penetrate the fatty acyl regions of the phospholipid bilayer, anchoring the protein to the membrane 
    * **Peripheral Membrane Proteins (Extrinsic Proteins)**: Are only temporarily associated with the membrane.
        * Most peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic so usually they are either attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can directly bound to a polar head group of the bilayer.
* **Glycoproteins (Glycopeptide)**: Any of a class of proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain.
* **Glycolipids**: Are lipids with a carbohydrate attached by a covalent bond.

## Miscellaneous

* You can remove **integral proteins** from the membrane are synthetic detergents, & nonpolar solvents and denaturing agents that disrupt the hydrophobic interactions of the bilayer
* Transmembrane proteins are throughout the plasma membrane. They transport molecules across the membrane. 
* Transmembrane proteins come in two types, alpha-helical and beta-barrels
* Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the membrane from only one side.

* **Extrinsic proteins** can be easily removed, which allows them to be involved in cell signaling. 
* **Peripheral membrane proteins** often associate with ion channels and transmembrane receptors

* **Glycoproteins** and **glycolipids** have a carbohydrate chain that is a label to identify cell types. 
* A, B, O blood groups result from having different carbohydrate chains on the cell surface of red blood cells and other types of cells. 
* People with type A have an additional carb called N-Acetylgalactosamine
* People type B have added galactose
* People with blood type AB have a little of both
