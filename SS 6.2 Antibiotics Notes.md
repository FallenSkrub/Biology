# Biology Notes

* Nosopharm, an unconvetional antiobiotic
	* Odilorhabids (ODLs) ~ Antibiotics made by symbiotic bacteria found in nemaode worms that colonize insects for food
		* Bacteria kills insect as well as creating more of it
	* Research team screened 80 strains of bacteria
		* Isolated active compounds, studied structures to engineer a better bacteria
	* ODLs act on the ribosome, they bind to a part of the ribosome (unlike other antibiotics). The antibiotic disrupts the ribosomes abilities to interpret and translate genetic code
		* Forces ribosome to make mistakes
		* Creates flawed proteins, which causes the cell to die
	* Majority of antibiotics slow cells, it's rare to have a bacteria that *kills* cells
	* Nosopharm could help since a lot of drugs humans have become resistant to most antibiotics
	* Tested on mice infected with pathogenic bacteria and it worked against Gram-negative & Gram-poisitive pathogens including **Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae**
		* **Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae** (CRE) ~ Family of germs with high levels of resistance to antibiotics
			* CRE contribute to death of up to 50% of patients who are infected
		* ODLs could have therapeutic potential, but hasn't been tested thoroughly yet
