# Chromosomes, the Cell Cycle, Cell Division
#### How do cells divide?

## Main Questions
* How do Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells divide?

# Chromosomes
* Prokaryotes divide by **Binary Fission**
	* Dividing in half allows a prokaryote to produce and identical copy of itself.
* Eukaryotes divide by **Mitosis** and **Meiosis**
	* Multple strands of DNA (chromosomes) require more coordination to replicate and redistribute themselves properly.

	Mitosis.

	Meiosis.
	
* Chromosomes ("Coloured Bodies")
	* A single piece of coiled DNA with associated proteins.
	* Only separate during cell division. When copies are connected, called sister **chromatids**.
	* At other times, in the form of loosely packed **chromatin** fibers.

# The Cell Cycle

* A cell receives signals (eg. growth factors) that trigger stages of the cell cycle.
* Interphase
	* Usually the longest phase
* G<sub>0</sub>
	* Cycle paused indefinitely
* G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>
	* "Gap" phases
* S
	* (DNA) Synthesis phase
* Mitotic Phase (M)
	* Where most of the activity occurs

The Cell Cycle.

* "IPMATC"
	* Interphase (In Between)
	* Prophase (Preperation)
	* Metaphase (Middle)
	* Anaphase (Apart)
	* Telophase (Terminated)
	* Cytokinesis (Copied)
