# Incomplete Dominance
* Dominant allele isn't completely expressed with recessive

R=Red

r=White

Non-Mendelian would make these violet instead of red final answers.

|     | r  | r  |
|-----|----|----|
|  R  | Rr | Rr |
|  R  | Rr | Rr |


|   | R | r |
|---|---|---|
| R | RR (red) | Rr (violet) |
| r | Rr (violet) | rr (white) |

* Could be shown as RW or Rr
* Neither one is truly dominant

# Codominance
* Could be shown as BW or C^B C^W
* Both alleles are expressed

# Polygenic Traits
* Many genes for one trait (Poly means many)
* Genetics aren't changed by nature

# Epistasis
* Gene depends on other gene to be expressed
* A gene is prevented by another gene
